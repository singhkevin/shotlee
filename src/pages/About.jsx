          <div className="legal-intro">
            <p>Shot Lee represents the greatest innovation in photography since the camera itself. We exist to eliminate the gap between what you capture and what you envision.</p>

            <h2 className="legal-section-title">Our Mission</h2>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">Every photograph tells a story. Yet too often, technical limitations, lighting conditions, or simple timing prevent that story from reaching its full potential. Shot Lee was born from a simple belief: no moment should be lost to mediocrity.</p>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">We've built an AI system that understands not just pixels, but the principles that separate great photography from the rest. Our algorithms analyze over 300 aesthetic parameters—from color harmony to emotional resonance—drawing from humanity's most iconic images to transform your photographs into extraordinary works.</p>

            <h2 className="legal-section-title">The Technology</h2>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">Shot Lee's enhancement engine is trained on the visual language of masters: the contrast that defined Ansel Adams, the composition that made Steve McCurry's portraits legendary, the color palettes that stop you mid-scroll.</p>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">Every image you submit is processed in real-time, analyzed across hundreds of parameters, and enhanced through four distinct professional interpretations. We don't store your images. We don't sell your data. We simply deliver excellence, instantly.</p>

          <section className="legal-section">
            <h2 className="legal-section-title">Our Commitment</h2>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">Professional excellence should be accessible. That's why we offer introductory pricing that makes gallery-quality enhancement available to everyone—from professional photographers to families preserving memories.</p>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">We believe in privacy without compromise. Your images are yours alone. We process, enhance, and deliver—then permanently delete everything. No storage. No sharing. No exceptions.</p>

            <h2 className="legal-section-title">The Future of Photography</h2>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">Shot Lee isn't just a tool. It's a new standard. A promise that every photograph you take can become the image you imagined. Whether it's a professional headshot, a family moment, or a vacation memory, we ensure it reaches its full potential.</p>
            <p className="legal-paragraph">Never accept mediocrity again.</p>
